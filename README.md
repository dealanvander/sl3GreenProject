# GREEN - Letter image identification to FSL
Project Description:
The code will identify the image of a letter and output the Filipino Sign Language (FSL) equivalent of that letter and vice versa. If the image of the letter is particularly noisy then the code will de-noise the image to better identify which letter the image is showing.
